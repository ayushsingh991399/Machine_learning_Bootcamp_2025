## Homework 1: Car Fuel Efficiency Analysis

**Description:**  
In my first homework, I analyzed the **Car Fuel Efficiency dataset**. The goal was to predict fuel efficiency using **linear regression**, explore features, handle missing values, and validate the model.

**Key learnings from this homework:**

- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Implementing Linear Regression from scratch and with Scikit-Learn
- Model evaluation and validation
